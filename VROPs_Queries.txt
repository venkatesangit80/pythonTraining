Subject: Request for vROps API Rate Limit & Capacity Review
Dear [Manager’s Name],

As part of our integration with vROps, we are collecting performance statistics (e.g., memory and CPU usage) for all resources and exporting them into Mimir/Prometheus for capacity insights. While our design is working well for small and medium endpoints (in the range of a few thousand resources), we are facing recurring issues with large endpoints (tens of thousands of resources, e.g., VirtualMachines).

Specifically:
	•	For large endpoints (~80k resources), the API starts returning HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) after a short period.
	•	We have already implemented Celery-level retry/backoff logic, but the sustained throughput limit still causes failures.
	•	For endpoints with fewer resources, the system works smoothly without errors.

To meet our SLA (collecting all data every 5 minutes), we need support from the vROps team in the following areas:
	1.	API Rate Limits
	•	Please confirm the current API rate limit configuration for our cluster.
	•	Can the limit for our service account(s) be increased, or can we be allocated higher quotas for bulk data collection?
	2.	Cluster Capacity
	•	Large-volume API usage may require additional analytics/remote collector nodes to handle the load.
	•	Can the cluster be reviewed for scale-out options so that sustained 80k resource fetches every 5 minutes are supported?
	3.	Operational Guidance
	•	Are there VMware best practices or recommended limits for the /stats/latest API with large batches?
	•	Would creating multiple service accounts for load distribution be acceptable?
	4.	Alternative Options
	•	We are also considering sharding large resource kinds into multiple smaller queries (by cluster/datacenter) to reduce per-call volume.
	•	We’d appreciate guidance from the vROps team if there are preferred ways to filter/scope API calls to balance system stability and completeness.

In summary: The system is proven to work end-to-end, but for large endpoints we need either higher API limits and/or cluster capacity improvements to consistently meet our SLA. Without this, retries alone are insufficient.

We kindly request the vROps team to review the API quota and infrastructure capacity, and suggest the best approach forward.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
