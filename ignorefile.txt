Here’s a structured justification for your requirement to deploy 150 pods to process VROPs data export from 81 clusters (~50,000 resources with 170 metrics each) every 5 minutes, within a 4-minute SLA.

⸻

What Are We Doing?

We are implementing a scalable and time-bound VROPs data export and processing pipeline that:
	•	Retrieves and processes metric data from 81 clusters.
	•	Each cluster contains a combined ~50,000 resources.
	•	Each resource exports 170 unique metrics.
	•	This results in 8.5 million data points per cycle.
	•	The job is scheduled to run every 5 minutes, with a target completion SLA of under 4 minutes.

⸻

Why Are We Doing This?
	•	Timely Observability: The goal is to ensure near real-time visibility into infrastructure health and application performance.
	•	Downstream Analytics: This data feeds into anomaly detection, forecasting, and automation triggers within our Modular Capacity Platform (MCP).
	•	SLA Commitment: The system is designed to serve live dashboards, alerts, and auto-remediation tasks, all of which rely on the availability of fresh, complete data within 4 minutes.
	•	Operational Reliability: Any delay in execution could cause alert lags, stale insights, or failure in capacity-related decisions and actions.

How Are We Doing It?
	•	The execution pipeline is containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes.
	•	The job is horizontally distributed across pods, each responsible for a deterministic chunk of clusters/resources/metrics.
	•	Work is sharded intelligently, ensuring minimal duplication or overlap.
	•	Each pod will:
	•	Authenticate with VROPs.
	•	Pull a specific slice of metric data.
	•	Transform and send the result to storage or a downstream processor.
	•	Retry, timeout, and rate-limit logic is in place to handle API throttling.

What Is Needed to Achieve the SLA?

Why 150 Pods?
	•	Total data points per cycle:
50,000 resources × 170 metrics = 8,500,000 metrics
	•	Execution window:
4 minutes = 240 seconds
	•	Each pod target throughput:
To meet the SLA, we estimate that each pod should handle ~56,667 metrics (8.5M / 150).
	•	Benchmarking result (example):
A pod can reliably process ~57,000 metrics (including API pull, transform, write) within ~220 seconds, under VROPs API and network constraints.

Other Considerations:
	•	Concurrency control to avoid API throttling from VROPs controller.
	•	Autoscaling if resource load or metric count grows.
	•	Pod affinity rules to spread load and avoid node-level saturation.
	•	Monitoring and logging for visibility and failure recovery.

Conclusion

To meet our SLA of 4 minutes for VROPs data export from 81 clusters with high metric volume, we require 150 parallel pods to handle the data volume efficiently. This setup ensures:
	•	Performance within SLA
	•	Fault isolation
	•	Scalable and observable architecture
	•	Readiness for real-time and automated infrastructure actions
