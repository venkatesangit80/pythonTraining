The behavior you‚Äôre observing‚Äî3 MB transferred on TAS vs 30 MB on OCP, both for a 30 MB resource‚Äîsuggests that TAS is using HTTP range requests or smart chunked transfer, while OCP is not. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

‚∏ª

üîç Why TAS Transfers Only 3 MB

TAS (Tanzu Application Service) may be:
	‚Ä¢	Using lazy loading or streaming, where only parts of the resource are fetched on demand.
	‚Ä¢	Client (like a browser or internal app) may issue HTTP Range requests to fetch small pieces of the file (e.g., first 3 MB for preview).
	‚Ä¢	Intermediate proxy or CDN could also optimize transfer by only pulling what the client requests.

Thus, only the needed part is sent over the wire (3 MB), not the full 30 MB.

‚∏ª

üö´ Why OCP Transfers Full 30 MB

On OpenShift (OCP), this could happen due to:
	‚Ä¢	No support or configuration for HTTP partial content (Range).
	‚Ä¢	Resource being eagerly loaded (e.g., curl, wget, full download APIs).
	‚Ä¢	Missing streaming headers like Accept-Ranges or Transfer-Encoding: chunked.

So even if the client wants only 3 MB, OCP delivers all 30 MB by default.

‚úÖ Can You Make OCP Behave Like TAS? Yes.

Here‚Äôs how you can achieve similar chunking/streaming in OCP:

1. Enable HTTP Range Support

Ensure the service or pod (e.g., NGINX, Spring Boot app) includes:

Accept-Ranges: bytes

This tells clients that they can fetch byte ranges.

2. Use a Reverse Proxy (like HAProxy/NGINX)

Configure your route/service to:
	‚Ä¢	Support range requests
	‚Ä¢	Use streaming instead of full download
	‚Ä¢	Cache responses partially if applicable

3. Modify Your App or API Gateway

If your app is serving files:
	‚Ä¢	Stream files via ResponseEntity<InputStreamResource> in Java/Spring.
	‚Ä¢	Use Content-Range and 206 Partial Content for custom file-serving APIs.

4. Client-side Optimization

Make sure the client (browser/app) uses:
	‚Ä¢	Range headers
	‚Ä¢	Preview APIs
	‚Ä¢	Partial download logic

üîß Example: Spring Boot Range Support (OCP-compatible)

@GetMapping("/resource")
public ResponseEntity<Resource> serveRange(
    @RequestHeader(value = "Range", required = false) String rangeHeader) {
    
    Resource fullFile = getFile();
    if (rangeHeader == null) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(fullFile);
    }

    // Parse range and return partial file
    HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
    headers.add("Content-Range", "bytes 0-2999999/30000000");
    headers.add("Accept-Ranges", "bytes");

    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.PARTIAL_CONTENT)
                         .headers(headers)
                         .body(getPartialFile());
}

‚úÖ Summary

Platform	Transfer	Reason	Fix
TAS	3 MB	Range or lazy streaming	Already optimized
OCP	30 MB	Eager full transfer	Enable Accept-Ranges, stream files
