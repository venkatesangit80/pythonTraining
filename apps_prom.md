Great question. Comparing TAS memory utilization (%) in Prometheus and Heap current utilization (%) in AppDynamics can be tricky because they represent different layers of memory usage.

‚∏ª

üîç 1. TAS Memory Utilization % (in Prometheus)

TAS (Tanzu Application Service / Cloud Foundry) reports memory usage at the container level.
	‚Ä¢	Measured by: Prometheus (via container_memory_usage_bytes or Cloud Foundry firehose exporters)
	‚Ä¢	Represents: Total memory used by the container, including:
	‚Ä¢	JVM heap
	‚Ä¢	JVM metaspace, code cache
	‚Ä¢	Native memory (e.g., buffers, threads, off-heap caches)
	‚Ä¢	Any memory leaks or native libraries

‚úÖ Includes: the entire process footprint
‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt care about what memory is used inside the JVM heap vs native

‚∏ª

üîç 2. Heap Current Utilization % (in AppDynamics)

AppDynamics monitors inside the JVM.
	‚Ä¢	Measured by: JVM agent (attached to the application)
	‚Ä¢	Represents: Used heap memory / Total heap memory
	‚Ä¢	Heap = space used for Java object allocation
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt include metaspace, thread stacks, or native allocations

‚úÖ Precise view of Java heap usage
‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt show total memory used by the app process

üß† Key Differences

Aspect	TAS Memory Utilization (Prometheus)	AppDynamics Heap Utilization (%)
Scope	Entire container memory (JVM + native)	Only JVM heap
Source	Prometheus node/container metrics	JVM Agent inside AppDynamics
Memory types included	Heap, off-heap, metaspace, threads, etc.	Only heap memory (e.g., -Xmx usage)
Units	% of container memory limit (e.g., 512MB)	% of -Xmx defined heap
Risk visibility	Native memory leaks, GC overhead visible	Only object allocation / GC scope

üìå Real-World Example

Let‚Äôs say:
	‚Ä¢	App is deployed with 512 MB memory in TAS
	‚Ä¢	JVM heap is capped at -Xmx256m

At runtime:
	‚Ä¢	App uses 200 MB heap
	‚Ä¢	Plus 80 MB metaspace + 40 MB native threads + 50 MB GC overhead

TAS memory usage:
200 + 80 + 40 + 50 = 370 MB ‚Üí ~72% of container memory

AppDynamics heap usage:
200 / 256 = ~78% of heap

‚Üí Both percentages are valid, but they‚Äôre about different things.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ When to Use What

Use Case	Metric to Trust
Detect total app memory usage / OOM risk	TAS/Prometheus container memory %
Detect GC pressure, heap leaks, object churn	AppDynamics heap %
Comparing allocations across apps	Heap % (for tuning -Xmx)
Alerting for crashes	TAS container memory %, App OOMKilled events

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a dashboard formula to correlate both or create an alerting strategy that combines them.
