Yes, this is absolutely possible‚Äîand it‚Äôs a very important observation in JVM-based applications running in TAS (Tanzu Application Service) and monitored via Prometheus and AppDynamics.

‚úÖ Recap of What Each Metric Means

üîπ TAS Memory Utilization % (in Prometheus)
	‚Ä¢	Measures: Total container memory used
	‚Ä¢	Includes:
	‚Ä¢	Heap
	‚Ä¢	Metaspace
	‚Ä¢	Code cache
	‚Ä¢	Thread stacks
	‚Ä¢	Off-heap buffers
	‚Ä¢	Native library memory
	‚Ä¢	GC overhead
	‚Ä¢	Leaks, memory fragmentation
	‚Ä¢	Reported by: container_memory_usage_bytes vs memory quota

üîπ AppDynamics Heap Current Utilization %
	‚Ä¢	Measures: Used JVM heap as a percentage of the heap (-Xmx)
	‚Ä¢	Only includes:
	‚Ä¢	Java object memory (Eden, Survivor, Old Gen)
	‚Ä¢	Excludes:
	‚Ä¢	Metaspace
	‚Ä¢	Native memory
	‚Ä¢	Threads
	‚Ä¢	Off-heap memory

‚∏ª

‚ùì So Why Is Prometheus Showing 90% While Heap Is Only 30%?

Metric	Value
Prometheus Memory Utilization	90% of 1 GB (e.g., 900 MB used)
AppDynamics Heap Utilization	30% of 512 MB heap (e.g., ~153 MB used)


‚∏ª

üß† Possible Causes (And They‚Äôre Valid)

‚úÖ 1. Metaspace Usage
	‚Ä¢	Class metadata, loaded classes, method info
	‚Ä¢	Common in frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate
	‚Ä¢	Not part of heap

‚úÖ 2. Off-Heap Memory
	‚Ä¢	Used by:
	‚Ä¢	DirectByteBuffers
	‚Ä¢	Netty
	‚Ä¢	gRPC
	‚Ä¢	Caching libraries (like Ehcache, Ignite)
	‚Ä¢	Not tracked by heap utilization

‚úÖ 3. Thread Stack Memory
	‚Ä¢	Each Java thread has its own stack (default ~1 MB)
	‚Ä¢	Apps with high concurrency can quickly consume native memory

‚úÖ 4. Native Libraries and JNI
	‚Ä¢	Any native code (e.g., image processing, encryption, compression) can allocate memory outside the JVM
	‚Ä¢	Will show up in container memory but not in heap metrics

‚úÖ 5. GC Overhead or Fragmentation
	‚Ä¢	GC temporary allocations, memory fragmentation, and memory held for reuse (not yet GC‚Äôd) can cause elevated total memory usage

üîç Example Breakdown

If your app is deployed with 1 GB container memory and:
	‚Ä¢	-Xmx (heap max) is set to 512 MB
	‚Ä¢	Heap usage is at 30% of 512 MB ‚âà 150 MB
	‚Ä¢	Metaspace: ~150 MB
	‚Ä¢	Threads: 200 threads √ó 1 MB = 200 MB
	‚Ä¢	Off-heap buffer cache: 300 MB
	‚Ä¢	GC overhead: 50 MB

Total memory usage = 150 + 150 + 200 + 300 + 50 = 850 MB ‚âà 85% ‚Üí matches Prometheus reading

‚úÖ What Should You Do?

üéØ Recommendation
	‚Ä¢	Keep monitoring both metrics:
	‚Ä¢	Prometheus memory % ‚Üí For crash risk (TAS OOM killer will terminate at 100%)
	‚Ä¢	Heap % ‚Üí For Java GC pressure and leaks
	‚Ä¢	Use jcmd or VisualVM if debugging memory locally:
	‚Ä¢	To inspect metaspace, threads, and off-heap usage
	‚Ä¢	Consider tools like AppDynamics Native Memory view or async-profiler for full memory breakdown
