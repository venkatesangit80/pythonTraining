That sounds like a well-structured OCP Capacity View presentation! Here‚Äôs a suggested PowerPoint (PPTX) structure to effectively communicate the Kubernetes (K8s) components, data flow, and capacity utilization views across different levels.

üèó Suggested PowerPoint Outline

1Ô∏è‚É£ Title Slide ‚Äì Introduction
	‚Ä¢	Title: OCP Capacity View ‚Äì Dashboard Overview
	‚Ä¢	Subtitle: Overview of Kubernetes Components, Data Flow, and Capacity Utilization for Applications and Platforms
	‚Ä¢	Your Name, Date, and Team (if applicable)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Overview Slide ‚Äì Objective & Scope
	‚Ä¢	Objective: Explain how OCP (OpenShift Container Platform) capacity is tracked and monitored across applications, platforms, and data centers.
	‚Ä¢	Scope:
	‚Ä¢	Breakdown of Kubernetes components
	‚Ä¢	Data flow from Kubernetes to Prometheus
	‚Ä¢	Capacity views for Platform & Applications
	‚Ä¢	Resource utilization & historical trends

3Ô∏è‚É£ Kubernetes Components Explained (Visual Diagram)
	‚Ä¢	Key K8s Components:
	‚Ä¢	Cluster ‚Üí Logical grouping of nodes
	‚Ä¢	Nodes ‚Üí Worker machines running workloads
	‚Ä¢	Namespace ‚Üí Logical isolation within a cluster
	‚Ä¢	Pods ‚Üí The smallest deployable units
	‚Ä¢	Containers ‚Üí Running applications inside pods
	‚Ä¢	Services & Ingress ‚Üí Networking components

(Visual representation showing these components in a simple flowchart)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Flow ‚Äì From Kubernetes to Prometheus (Flow Diagram)
	‚Ä¢	Data Flow Explanation:
	‚Ä¢	Kubernetes collects performance metrics
	‚Ä¢	Exporters (Node Exporter, cAdvisor, Kube State Metrics) collect data
	‚Ä¢	Prometheus scrapes metrics
	‚Ä¢	Data is visualized in Grafana/Capacity Dashboard
	‚Ä¢	Visual: Diagram showing K8s components ‚Üí Exporters ‚Üí Prometheus ‚Üí Dashboard

5Ô∏è‚É£ Platform-Level Capacity View (Dashboard Representation)
	‚Ä¢	What‚Äôs Monitored at Platform Level?
	‚Ä¢	Clusters
	‚Ä¢	Namespaces
	‚Ä¢	Pods
	‚Ä¢	Containers
	‚Ä¢	Applications
	‚Ä¢	Resource Utilization Across Data Centers & Clusters
	‚Ä¢	Memory Usage
	‚Ä¢	CPU Usage
	‚Ä¢	Storage Consumption

(Include a sample dashboard screenshot with graphs, heatmaps, and stats)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Application-Level Capacity View (Tabular & Graphical View)
	‚Ä¢	Table Representation of Resources:
	‚Ä¢	Configured Pods
	‚Ä¢	Containers
	‚Ä¢	Namespaces
	‚Ä¢	CPU/Memory Requests & Limits
	‚Ä¢	Drill-down Feature: Clicking an app shows 90-day historical usage trends

(Include a table with sample data & a graph visualizing a 90-day trend)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Landing Page ‚Äì OCP Configured Applications (High-Level Dashboard View)
	‚Ä¢	Overview of OCP Configured Apps:
	‚Ä¢	Total Applications using OCP
	‚Ä¢	% of Apps Using OCP vs. Non-OCP
	‚Ä¢	Cluster-Level OCP Adoption
	‚Ä¢	Dashboard Screenshot Example:
	‚Ä¢	Heatmap / Pie chart showing how many apps are using OCP

8Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages of This Capacity View (Key Takeaways)
	‚Ä¢	Platform-Level View Benefits
‚úÖ Helps optimize resource allocation
‚úÖ Identifies underutilized clusters
‚úÖ Prevents over-provisioning
	‚Ä¢	Application-Level View Benefits
‚úÖ Provides deep insights into app performance
‚úÖ Helps in proactive capacity planning
‚úÖ Identifies trends and anomalies

9Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion & Next Steps
	‚Ä¢	Summary of Key Insights
	‚Ä¢	Future Enhancements (if applicable)
	‚Ä¢	Q&A

üé® Design Tips for PPTX
	‚Ä¢	Use Visual Diagrams: Flowcharts for data flow, heatmaps for utilization, and tables for application resources.
	‚Ä¢	Dashboard Screenshots: Show sample dashboard widgets with real or mock data.
	‚Ä¢	Color Coding:
	‚Ä¢	Green üü¢ ‚Üí Healthy Resources
	‚Ä¢	Yellow üü° ‚Üí Warning (Moderate Usage)
	‚Ä¢	Red üî¥ ‚Üí Critical Resource Consumption
