Request for Additional Resource Allocation – Critical Implementation of KPIs, Forecasting, and Performance Enhancements

Objective & Business Impact

To enhance our system’s capabilities, we need to integrate external connectors with Beams and EDE to bring all key performance indicators (KPIs) into the system. This is essential for improving monitoring, forecasting, and decision-making across multiple environments.

Scope of Work & Implementation Priorities
	1.	KPI Integration Across Platforms
	•	Extend KPI tracking beyond CPU and Memory to include Disk, Filesystem (FS), and Network Interface Controller (NIC).
	•	Ensure full KPI integration across PM/VM, TAS, TKGI, OCP, and VMware environments.
	•	Enable comprehensive over-utilized and under-utilized logic implementation.
	2.	Capacity Forecasting Enhancement
	•	Expand capacity forecasting beyond CPU and Memory to include all infrastructure components.
	•	Improve forecast accuracy by transitioning from simple linear regression to Deep Learning and Generative AI models.
	3.	Performance Optimization through Redis-Based Caching
	•	Implement Redis-based caching mechanisms to enhance infrastructure-level capacity visualization and performance.
	4.	Enhancement of “Where My Workload Is” Feature
	•	Ensure all KPIs are incorporated into this feature for better workload tracking and optimization.
	•	Extend support for TAS, TKGI, OCP, and VMware.

Resource Constraints & Request
	•	Currently, only Udaya and I are available to execute these critical tasks.
	•	Carlos, with his Python and Data Science expertise, can significantly contribute to these implementations.
	•	However, his current 50% allocation to MCAP and 50% to MSSP UI development poses a challenge.
	•	UI development requires learning curve efforts, impacting overall execution speed and efficiency.

Request for Reallocation
	•	To successfully deliver these high-priority enhancements, we request Carlos to be allocated 80% to our project, at least until April 2025.
	•	This will ensure we meet key milestones and strategic objectives effectively.

Conclusion

Allocating Carlos at 80% will be critical to achieving:
✅ Full KPI integration across all required environments.
✅ Enhanced forecasting accuracy with AI-driven models.
✅ Performance improvements through caching mechanisms.
✅ Strengthening of workload tracking for infrastructure optimization.

We appreciate your consideration and support in prioritizing this request.

This version makes the case stronger, more structured, and presents the request with clear business impact and justifications. Let me know if you need further refinements!
