Great question — the short answer is: not exactly.

dagster-celery ≠ Full Celery

dagster-celery uses Celery under the hood, but it’s tailored for Dagster’s use case: orchestrating data pipelines. So while it leverages Celery, it doesn’t expose or replace all of Celery’s features.

⸻

What dagster-celery can do (via Celery):
	•	Run each op (step) of a Dagster job as a Celery task
	•	Distribute ops across multiple workers
	•	Handle retries, timeouts, and failures
	•	Support concurrent execution
	•	Use Redis/RabbitMQ as broker
	•	Integrate with Dagster’s logging, events, and monitoring

⸻

What dagster-celery doesn’t do:
	•	General-purpose task queuing outside of Dagster jobs (e.g. independent Celery tasks)
	•	Scheduled periodic tasks like @periodic_task in Celery (Dagster handles scheduling its own way)
	•	Full access to Celery’s advanced task patterns: chains, chords, groups, etc. (you’d use Dagster’s own graph composition instead)
	•	Custom Celery worker logic unrelated to pipelines

⸻

Think of it like this:
	•	Celery: full-featured task queue system
	•	Dagster: data orchestrator
	•	dagster-celery: lets Dagster use Celery as a backend to run pipeline steps in parallel/distributed fashion — but within Dagster’s orchestration model

⸻

TL;DR:

If you’re already using Celery to run arbitrary business logic or scheduled tasks — keep using Celery directly.

If you’re building data pipelines or ETL jobs, and want distributed execution — dagster-celery is great, but it won’t fully replace general-purpose Celery.
