Here’s a breakdown of the terms related to Kubernetes (K8s) and infrastructure:

1. Data Centers

A data center is a facility that houses computing and networking equipment. It provides power, cooling, networking, and security for hosting applications and services.
	•	Example: AWS, Google Cloud, or on-premises servers.

2. Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications. It consists of:
	•	Master Node (Control Plane) – Manages the cluster.
	•	Worker Nodes – Run the applications inside Pods.

3. Environment (Env)

Represents the deployment stage of an application.
	•	Common environments:
	•	Dev (Development) – For testing by developers.
	•	QA (Quality Assurance) – Testing before release.
	•	Staging – Pre-production testing.
	•	Production (Prod) – Live applications serving users.

4. Namespace

A namespace in Kubernetes is a logical partition within a cluster.
	•	Used for isolating workloads between different teams or applications.
	•	Example: dev-namespace, prod-namespace, monitoring-namespace.

5. Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
	•	A pod contains one or more containers that share network and storage.
	•	Example: A pod running a web application and a database sidecar container.

6. CPU Limit

Defines the maximum CPU a container can use.
	•	If a container exceeds this limit, Kubernetes throttles it.
	•	Example: cpu limit = 2 cores → The container can’t use more than 2 CPU cores.

7. Memory (Mem) Limit

Defines the maximum memory a container can consume.
	•	If a container exceeds this, it may be killed (OOMKilled).
	•	Example: mem limit = 4Gi → The container can’t use more than 4GB RAM.

8. Requested CPU (Req CPU)

The minimum CPU guaranteed for a container.
	•	Ensures it gets enough resources.
	•	Example: req cpu = 0.5 cores → The container gets at least 0.5 cores, but can use more if available.

9. Requested Memory (Req Mem)

The minimum memory guaranteed for a container.
	•	Ensures it gets the required memory.
	•	Example: req mem = 2Gi → The container gets at least 2GB RAM.

10. Memory Working Set (Mem Working Set)

Represents the actual memory usage of a container.
	•	It’s the actively used memory that isn’t swapped out.
	•	Helps in monitoring real-time memory consumption.
