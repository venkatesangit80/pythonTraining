Here are the release notes for the three views:

Release Notes

Feature 1: Datacenter Overview Dashboard

Description:
This dashboard provides a high-level overview of resource utilization across multiple datacenters categorized into production and non-production environments. It displays critical metrics for clusters, nodes, pods, and containers with detailed resource utilization percentages for CPU and memory.

Key Highlights:
	•	Overview of clusters, nodes, pods, and containers for all environments.
	•	Visual representation of CPU and Memory Utilization to quickly assess resource health.
	•	Displays memory metrics (used, limits, and requests) for granular insights into resource allocation.
	•	Easy toggle between production and non-production views for targeted monitoring.

Feature 2: OCP Capacity View

Description:
This feature introduces an OCP Capacity View that consolidates resource usage across all datacenters in a single, unified view. It allows for environment-specific (e.g., production or non-production) filtering and provides summary metrics for namespaces, containers, and applications.

Key Highlights:
	•	Filters for datacenters, environments, and clusters for precise monitoring.
	•	Aggregate metrics, including the total number of clusters, nodes, pods, namespaces, containers, and applications.
	•	Dynamic color-coded utilization indicators for visual clarity on resource usage levels (e.g., free, 40%, 60% utilization).
	•	Centralized view to identify overall capacity and optimize resource distribution.

Feature 3: Cluster-Specific Resource Utilization

Description:
This feature provides a detailed breakdown of resource utilization at the cluster level, enabling deeper insights into specific cluster performance. Each cluster’s CPU and memory utilization are displayed alongside memory usage details.

Key Highlights:
	•	View of nodes, pods, and containers per cluster for a detailed understanding.
	•	CPU and memory utilization percentages for individual clusters with clear indicators of overutilization or underutilization.
	•	Detailed metrics for memory (used, limits, and requests) for informed decision-making.
	•	Helps isolate performance bottlenecks and optimize individual cluster configurations.

These features aim to enhance observability and provide actionable insights for improved resource management across datacenters and clusters.
