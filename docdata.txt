You’ve got it exactly right! Let’s expand on this idea for clarity:

Logical Sets of Metrics

Metrics can be grouped into logical sets where related metrics provide a complete picture of an application’s behavior. If any metric in the set is missing, it could indicate a gap in monitoring.

Example Logical Set (API Monitoring):
	•	Request Count (request_count): Tracks the number of API calls.
	•	Response Time (response_time): Measures how quickly the API responds.
	•	Error Rate (error_rate): Tracks the percentage of API failures.

For the system to be well-monitored, all three metrics must exist for every API or endpoint. Missing any metric from this set leaves the application at risk of undetected issues.

Solution Approach

Step 1: Dynamically Identify and Categorize Metrics
	1.	Collect Metrics:
	•	Use PromQL queries to fetch all available metrics from Prometheus.
	•	Example:

{__name__=~".*"}


	•	This retrieves all metric names, values, and associated labels (e.g., application name, endpoint, etc.).

	2.	Categorize Metrics into Logical Sets:
	•	Group related metrics into predefined logical sets. For example:
	•	API Monitoring Set: request_count, response_time, error_rate
	•	Resource Usage Set: cpu_usage, memory_usage, disk_io
	•	Database Metrics Set: query_count, query_latency, query_failures
	•	Match metrics dynamically using patterns or labels (e.g., regex like _latency, _count, _rate).

Step 2: Check for Monitoring Completeness
	1.	Validate Each Logical Set:
	•	For every application, verify if all metrics in a logical set are present.
	•	Example for API monitoring:
	•	If request_count exists but response_time or error_rate is missing, flag this as incomplete monitoring for that API.
	2.	Identify Missing Metrics:
	•	Use logic to compare metrics against the expected set.
	•	Example:

absent({__name__=~"request_count|response_time|error_rate"})


	•	This identifies applications missing any part of the logical set.

Step 3: Generate Insights
	1.	Gap Reports:
	•	Highlight applications or endpoints missing metrics from their logical sets.
	•	Example report entry:

App Name: FoodDeliveryAPI
Logical Set: API Monitoring
Missing Metrics: response_time, error_rate


	2.	Recommendations:
	•	Suggest adding the missing metrics to ensure complete observability.

Outcome

By dynamically identifying and categorizing metrics into logical sets, the system ensures:
	•	Every critical aspect of the application is monitored.
	•	Gaps are detected and flagged proactively.
	•	Observability becomes standardized and scalable across thousands of applications.
