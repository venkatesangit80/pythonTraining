Writing to a shared location in Python with performance optimization, especially when dealing with large files, requires careful planning to ensure efficient I/O operations and minimize network latency. Here’s how you can achieve it:

Best Approach: Write Locally, Then Move to Shared Location
	1.	Why This Works:
	•	Writing locally reduces the latency caused by network file operations.
	•	Moving a file to the shared location after it’s complete ensures fewer write interruptions.
	2.	Steps:
	•	Write data to a local file.
	•	Monitor the file size.
	•	Once the file reaches 10 MB, close it, move it to the shared location, and start writing to a new file.

Key Features of This Implementation
	1.	Chunk-Based Writing:
	•	Writes data in chunks (chunk_size) to avoid memory overhead.
	2.	File Size Monitoring:
	•	Automatically switches to a new file once the current file reaches 10 MB.
	3.	Efficient File Movement:
	•	Uses shutil.move() to transfer files to the shared location after completion.
	4.	Local Temporary Folder:
	•	Ensures local operations are fast and reduces network load.

Performance Tuning Tips
	1.	Adjust Chunk Size:
	•	Increase the chunk_size (e.g., 64 KB or 128 KB) for faster writes, depending on your system’s I/O capabilities.
	2.	Buffering:
	•	Utilize buffered writes by opening files with a larger buffer size:

open(file_path, "wb", buffering=8192)


	3.	Parallel Processing:
	•	If you have multiple data streams, consider parallelizing file writing and moving using threads or multiprocessing.
	4.	Avoid Frequent File Moves:
	•	Ensure the local disk has sufficient space to accumulate files before moving them to the shared location in batches.
