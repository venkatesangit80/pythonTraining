Subject: Clarification on AppDynamics Heap vs Grafana Cloud Infrastructure Metrics

Dear [Customer’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

This is in reference to the discrepancy observed between the AppDynamics heap metric (showing ~30%) and the Grafana Cloud TAS instance’s infrastructure memory metric (showing ~90%).

I’d like to clarify that the heap metric in AppDynamics is an application-level metric. It specifically measures the heap memory portion allocated for the application’s runtime, such as object creation and garbage collection. This does not account for other memory regions such as metaspace, permgen, thread stacks, or native memory.

In contrast, the Grafana Cloud metric for TAS reflects infrastructure-level memory utilization. It captures the total memory usage of the instance, including all system-level allocations—spanning across application memory (heap and non-heap), system processes, and other container-level overheads.

Additionally, AppDynamics offers other relevant memory metrics—such as non-heap memory usage, permgen/metaspace, and overall memory pools—which, when considered together, provide a more complete picture of the application’s memory consumption. These metrics, when added up, often align more closely with the infrastructure-level utilization reported by Grafana Cloud.

Please let us know if you’d like a deep dive into these additional metrics or if you’d prefer a consolidated view for correlation.

Looking forward to your thoughts.
