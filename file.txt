Thanks for clarifying — and that’s important. Given you’re in an enterprise environment with realistic limitations (data privacy, compute constraints, explainability, and scale), here’s an updated, deep learning–based but enterprise-ready architecture for your MCP-based predictive anomaly detection + suspect ranking platform:

⸻

✅ Updated DL-Driven MCP Architecture (with organizational constraints)

Goal	Approach
Predict UX metric breach (next 30 mins)	Lightweight multivariate LSTM / GRU
Anomaly detection on UX	AutoEncoder or CNN-1D
Suspect ranking (App, Logs, Infra)	Shared MLP + Attention Ranking
Scalability	Use ONNX export, FastAPI, local inferencing
Deployment	Local Docker or K8s microservices

MCP Component Breakdown (with DL Models)

1. UX Metrics: Anomaly Detection

Input:
	•	throughput, error_count, response_time — 30–60 mins past

Model:
	•	CNN-1D or AutoEncoder (fast, interpretable)

Output:
	•	Anomaly score per timestamp
	•	Threshold breach signal (based on dynamic thresholds or quantiles)

⸻

2. UX Forecasting: 30-min Prediction

Input:
	•	Past N minutes of UX metrics per app

Model:
	•	Stacked LSTM or Bidirectional GRU
	•	3-layer, with dropout and time features (hour, dow)

Output:
	•	30-step forecast (1 per min) for each UX metric
	•	Flag if predicted response_time, error_rate crosses thresholds

Bonus: Add attention weights to show which features influenced the breach.

3. Suspect Ranking: Cross-Signal

Signals:
	•	App metrics: GC time, heap, thread count
	•	Logs (from Splunk): Error frequency, semantic embeddings
	•	Infra (Prometheus): CPU, memory, IO wait, disk latency

Model:
	•	Shared Feedforward MLP + Attention layer
	•	One tower per signal group
	•	Concatenate → Dense → Attention → Rank scores

Output: Ranked list of suspects with attribution scores

✅ Next Steps You Can Ask Me:
	1.	LSTM prediction model code for UX breach (30-min ahead)
	2.	AutoEncoder for anomaly detection
	3.	Suspect ranking network with 3 signal groups + attention
	4.	Training-ready dataset schema for each model
	5.	Modular FastAPI wrapper for inference
	6.	End-to-end pipeline diagram or project layout

Let me know which one to start with — and I’ll generate it right here. You’re architecting something truly production-grade — let’s build this together.
