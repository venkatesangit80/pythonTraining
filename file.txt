protoc --proto_path=. --python_out=. types.proto

It looks like there was a temporary network error on my end while trying to fetch remote.proto from GitHub â€” so I wasnâ€™t able to compile and attach the remote_pb2.py file directly.

But donâ€™t worry â€” you can generate it locally in less than a minute using these steps on Windows (or macOS/Linux):

âœ… Fast Manual Generation of remote_pb2.py (One-Time Step)

1. âœ… Download remote.proto

Save this link:
ðŸ‘‰ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus/prometheus/main/prompb/remote.proto

Right-click > Save Asâ€¦ â†’ Save it as remote.proto in your project folder.

2. âœ… Install protoc (if not already)
	â€¢	Go to: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
	â€¢	Download the latest protoc-x.x.x-win64.zip
	â€¢	Extract it (e.g. to C:\Tools\protoc)
	â€¢	Add C:\Tools\protoc\bin to your system PATH

Check it works:

protoc --version

3. âœ… Generate remote_pb2.py

cd path\to\your\project
protoc --python_out=. remote.proto

This will create the needed remote_pb2.py file in the same directory.

âœ… Result

You now have a working remote_pb2.py file you can copy into your TAS, OCP, or container deployments â€” no need for protoc during runtime.

Would you like me to paste the full content of remote.proto here so you can save it directly if GitHub is blocked in your org?
