User Story

Title: Metric VROPs – Implement Prometheus-Friendly API Layer

⸻

Summary

As a Lead Software Engineer,
I want to implement a Prometheus-compatible API that serves VROPs (vRealize Operations) metrics,
So that Celery-based background jobs can feed Redis, and Grafana or any Prometheus visualization tool can consume the data in a reliable and standardized way.

⸻

Description

This implementation will bridge the VROPs metric ingestion pipeline with Prometheus-friendly consumers (such as Grafana) through a clean, performant, and cache-driven REST API.

Key steps:
	1.	Data Writing Layer
	•	Ensure Celery workers (or schedulers) are continuously and reliably writing VROPs metric data into Redis with expected keys and TTLs.
	•	Validate metrics include: CPU, memory, disk, and cluster health scores with timestamps.
	2.	API Layer
	•	Build a REST API using FastAPI or Flask that reads from Redis and exposes endpoints in a format Prometheus or Grafana understands.
	•	Support for Prometheus-style scrape or /metrics endpoint returning text/plain content-type if required.
	3.	Visualization Layer
	•	Confirm Grafana is able to query the API, parse metrics correctly, and display real-time dashboards.
	•	Ensure the API supports tags/labels for filtering by cluster, object, and metric type.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria
	•	✅ Celery successfully writes metrics into Redis with appropriate structure, keys, and expiry
	•	✅ API responds correctly with current metric values from Redis
	•	✅ API supports Prometheus-compatible formatting (or JSON for Grafana plugins)
	•	✅ Grafana dashboards are able to poll the API and render real-time data without timeout
	•	✅ Logging and error handling are in place (e.g., if Redis is down or data is stale)
	•	✅ Code is committed, documented, and deployed to internal dev environment
	•	✅ Walkthrough/demo presented to team for future extensibility

⸻

Notes
	•	Consider using Prometheus /metrics format only if explicitly needed; otherwise, JSON endpoints can be Grafana-compatible.
	•	Redis keys should follow a naming convention: vrops:<cluster>:<metric>:<timestamp>.
