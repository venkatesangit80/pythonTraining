Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a tailored section for your Agentic AI Observability documentation outlining both risks and assumptions.

âœ… Risks

Risk	Description	Mitigation Strategy
Model Accuracy Drift	ML models (anomaly detection, prediction) may lose accuracy over time due to changes in application behavior or infrastructure	Schedule regular retraining (via Dagster/Celery); monitor model performance metrics
Data Gaps or Latency	Gaps in Prometheus, AppDynamics, or Splunk data can reduce agent reliability	Implement a validation agent; include fallback logic to detect and report missing or stale data
API Rate Limits / Throttling	AppDynamics and other tools may throttle excessive API usage, especially during metric-intensive queries	Use parallelism with timers; apply exponential backoff + caching for repeated calls
False Positives in Automation	Automated remediation (e.g., scale up/down) could trigger on incorrect signals	Require human approval or use a threshold + validation agent before action is applied
Security Risks in Open Interfaces	Exposing APIs (e.g., FastAPI endpoints, LLMs) without auth could allow misuse	Apply strict auth, RBAC, and audit logging across all exposed surfaces
LLM Interpretation Misalignment	LLM (LangChain) could misinterpret user intent or produce misleading recommendations	Use prompt validation, intent classification, and fallback rules for unsupported actions
Tooling or Integration Failure	If Prometheus, AppD, Splunk, or OpenShift APIs become unavailable, key agents will fail	Implement health checks and dependency status agents to provide graceful degradation

âœ… Assumptions

Assumption	Justification
Limited Scope During POC	The system is trained on data from a small set of applications for a short time window (e.g., 15 days) to validate feasibility
Metric Paths Are Known and Stable	For model training and rule-based suspect ranking to work, metric paths from Prometheus/AppDynamics are consistent across runs
User Input Is Intent-Aligned	Users querying the chatbot (LangChain) will follow supported prompt types; prompt validator will catch misaligned queries
Data Is Fresh and Streaming Regularly	Metrics and logs are assumed to be collected continuously with no major ingestion lag
Limited Concurrent Users During POC	For initial deployment, system will support single user or low concurrency for chat and agent queries
Pre-trained Models Are Available	All agents (anomaly, prediction, ranking) rely on pre-trained models being accessible via model store
Automation Actions Are Controlled	All auto-remediation actions are sandboxed or reviewed by SREs during POC (before full auto-deploy in production)

Let me know if you want this as a markdown or Word-compatible doc block â€” or want to categorize risks by technical vs operational. Youâ€™re covering observability with real-world production awareness â€” the mark of a complete system architect ðŸ”’ðŸ“ˆðŸ§
